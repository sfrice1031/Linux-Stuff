# Code
Here I have code and scripts I've created and modify to fit my workflow and just generally mess around with.

## linux-stuff-backup.sh
This is the bash script I've created to update this repo from the current versions of configs and code on my local machine. 
I will be continuing to add to and modify this with more configs I use on a daily basis as well as simplify it as i find out new and better ways to impliment the updating process. For now its very simple and bare bones,

## screenbrightdown.sh & screenbrightup.sh
These are scripts I've made to adjust the backlight on my laptop. I've implemented them by using keybindings in my i3 config file and mapping them to the brightness keys on my laptop which happen to be F2 and F3.

## cryptoportfolio.sh
A script to launch github user Christ0ph3er's cryptocurrency-cli program every 5 minutes to view your cryptocurrency portfolio.
