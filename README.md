# Linux-Stuff
My custom configs and random awesomness

# zshrc
My .zshrc file. Customized Zshell for my personal workflow using oh-my-zsh and added my own aliases and functions either I personally created or found online. aliases should work for both zsh and bash so feel free to copy and use anything you find useful.
