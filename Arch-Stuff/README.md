# Arch-Stuff
My custom configs and scripts for my Arch Linux setup.

## My Setup
My setup consists of the Awesome Window Manager, ZSH, URXVT terminal, Ranger File Manager, and Vim to start with. 

## zshrc
My .zshrc file. Customized Zshell for my personal workflow using oh-my-zsh and added my own aliases and functions I either personally created or found online. aliases should work for both zsh and bash so feel free to copy and use anything you find useful.

## Xresources
.Xresources file I use to customize how the URXVT terminal looks and feels. I commented out features that i found useful and wanted to keep incase I wanted to reimplement them later even though they dont currently have a place in my current set up. the colors used are zenburn colors that look amazing if you are using a zenburn color scheme on your machine.

## AwesomeWM rc.lua
Awesome Window Manager rc.lua file I've been tinkering with. Pretty much default for now with the exception of my 6 tags and their default window layouts.
