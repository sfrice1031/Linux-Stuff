# Arch-Stuff
My custom configs and scripts for my Arch Linux setup.

## My Setup
My setup consists of the i3 window manager, ZSH shell, URXVT terminal, Ranger File Manager, and Vim to start with. 

## zshrc
My .zshrc file. Customized Zshell for my personal workflow using oh-my-zsh and added my own aliases and functions I either personally created or found online. aliases should work for both zsh and bash so feel free to copy and use anything you find useful.

## Xresources
.Xresources file I use to customize how the URXVT terminal looks and feels. I commented out features that i found useful and wanted to keep incase I wanted to reimplement them later even though they dont currently have a place in my current set up. the colors used are zenburn colors that look amazing if you are using a zenburn color scheme on your machine.

## i3 config
My configuration file for the i3 window manager. Customised for my specific workflow. I've used quite a bit from using and modifying some examples from [Luke Smith's](https://www.github.com/lukesmithxyz) config files.

## Qutebrowser
My Qutebrowser config files. a very bare bones config containing a few search engine short cuts for the arch wiki, google, youtube, and github. It still uses duckduckgo for the default engine though.

##vimrc
My .vimrc file. Installed vundle and added helpfull plugins and the Zenburn color scheme for my own personal workflow.
