# Search engines which can be used via the address bar. Maps a search
# engine name (such as `DEFAULT`, or `ddg`) to a URL with a `{}`
# placeholder. The placeholder will be replaced by the search term, use
# `{{` and `}}` for literal `{`/`}` signs. The search engine named
# `DEFAULT` is used when `url.auto_search` is turned on and something
# else than a URL was entered to be opened. Other search engines can be
# used by prepending the search engine name to the search term, e.g.
# `:open google qutebrowser`.
